#ActivityModel

This module defines the data structure and model for an Activity using MobX State Tree (MST). An activity represents a specific task or event with an associated time range.
Structure:

    ActivityModel: This is the MST model for the activity. It consists of an id to uniquely identify the activity, a name which provides a human-readable label or title for the activity, and a timeRange which uses the TimeRangeModel to describe when the activity takes place.

    Attributes:
        id (number): A unique identifier for the activity.
        name (string): The human-readable name or title of the activity.
        timeRange (TimeRangeModel): An instance of the TimeRangeModel which describes the start and end times of the activity.

    Usage:

    typescript

const myActivity = ActivityModel.create({
  id: 1,
  name: "Morning Jog",
  timeRange: { start: "07:00", end: "08:00" }
});

IActivity (Interface): This TypeScript interface provides a type definition for the Activity model, ensuring that objects of this type conform to the required structure.

Attributes:

    id (number): A unique identifier for the activity.
    name (string): The human-readable name or title of the activity.
    timeRange (ITimeRange): A type representation of the TimeRangeModel.

Usage:

typescript

    function displayActivity(activity: IActivity) {
      console.log(`${activity.name} from ${activity.timeRange.start} to ${activity.timeRange.end}`);
    }

Dependencies:

    TimeRangeModel: This model, imported from the TimeRange directory, provides a structure for representing a specific range of time. It's linked to the ActivityModel to define when an activity takes place.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the ActivityModel module's purpose, structure, and usage. It can be placed at the top of the respective file or in a corresponding README.


    the value of the start time input changes. It returns the current value of the start time input.

    Type: (value: string) => void

    onEndTimeChange (Function): A callback function triggered when the value of the end time input changes. It returns the current value of the end time input.

    Type: (value: string) => void

    additionalClasses (String, optional): An additional string of CSS classes for custom styling.

    Default: ""

    ...props: The component accepts any standard HTML input attributes like name, id, etc., ensuring flexibility and broad usability across various contexts.



The TimeRange component allows users to specify a range of time using two input fields: one for the start time and one for the end time. The component is designed with customization in mind, accepting both standard HTML input attributes as well as specific properties for the start and end time functionalities.
Properties:

    startTime (String): The current value of the start time input.

    Type: string

    endTime (String): The current value of the end time input.

    Type: string

    onStartTimeChange (Function): A callback function triggered when 

<TimeRange
  startTime="10:00"
  endTime="12:00"
  onStartTimeChange={value => console.log(`Start Time: ${value}`)}
  onEndTimeChange={value => console.log(`End Time: ${value}`)}
  additionalClasses="text-blue-500"
/>

Implementation:

    BASE_CLASSES: A constant string holding base styles for the input. This ensures consistent styling across all instances of the TimeRange component.

    Computed Classes: The computedClasses combines the base styles and any additional styles provided to achieve the final look for the time inputs.

    Event Handlers: Two separate handlers – handleStartTimeChange and handleEndTimeChange – manage the change events for each input field, ensuring that the specific callback provided to each is triggered correctly.

Recommendations:

    Styling Enhancements: As the project grows, consider moving to a CSS-in-JS solution or a utility-based CSS framework for dynamic styling capabilities.

    Event Handling: In the future, consider adding handlers for other key events like onBlur, onFocus, etc., to increase the component's interactivity and responsiveness.

    Fetch Data: There's a commented-out useEffect in the component. If you need to fetch some server-side data using Next.js (for instance, to get default time range values), you can utilize this structure. Ensure that the API endpoint is appropriately secure and efficient.
