Ben Franklin App: A Productivity Tool Inspired by Time
Overview:

The Ben Franklin App is inspired by the age-old principles of time management and productivity, brought to life with a modern tech stack. This application is designed to help users structure their day, prioritize tasks, and make the most of their time, just as Benjamin Franklin did.
Core Features & Technologies:

    Next.js: The powerhouse behind our server-rendered React application. It provides a great developer experience with features like hot-code reloading, automatic routing, and static exporting.

    MobX State Tree (MST): For reactive state management. MST enables efficient and intuitive state updates and ensures data consistency across components.

    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework, which allows for rapid UI development and ensures a responsive and consistent design across the app.

    Modular Structure: The codebase is organized into key areas:
        Components: Divided into generic and specialized directories, these React components are the visual building blocks of our UI.
        Models: Define the shape and structure of our data entities, ensuring type safety and logical consistency.
        Stores: Central hubs for managing application state and business logic, linking the UI to the underlying data.

Getting Started:

    Installation: Clone the repository and follow the setup guidelines to run the app locally.

    Exploring the Codebase: Navigate through the directories to understand the flow and integration of components, models, and stores. Each significant module is documented for clarity.

    Feedback & Contributions: We're always open to feedback and contributions. Help us refine the app, fix bugs, or introduce new features.

We're excited to have you explore the Ben Franklin App. Harnessing the principles of one of history's greatest polymaths, combined with today's cutting-edge technologies, we hope to provide a tool that truly aids productivity and time management. Enjoy!
